# Titanic-Dataset-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-(EDA)
Overview
This repository contains my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The Titanic dataset is a well-known dataset used in introductory data analysis and machine learning projects. The analysis explores various aspects of the dataset to understand patterns, relationships, and insights that can be derived from the data.

Contents
Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks containing the code for data exploration, visualization, and analysis.
Data: CSV file containing the Titanic dataset used in the analysis.
Plots: Folder containing visualizations generated during the analysis.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the repository and instructions.
Analysis Highlights
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, transforming variables, etc.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing distributions, correlations, and relationships between variables.
Insights and Visualizations: Key findings and visual summaries of the dataset.
Tools Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
Jupyter Notebook for interactive data analysis
